BCA 6th Semester(T.U) Network Programming Lab

1) WAP to find the IP address and MAC address of your local machine. (Hint: Use getter or factory method.

2) WAP that lists all the network interfaces of your machine (ie localhost).

3) WAP to get and print the IP address of the given named host

a. www.scst.edu.np

b. www.google.com

c. www.facebook.com:

Why are there more than two IP addresses of the given last two hosts? Explain.

4) WAP to determine whether an IP address is v4 or v6? (Possibly to the command line argument)

5) Test the characteristics of a given IP address

a. 127.0.0.1

b. 0::1 (loopback | global | unicast)

6) WAP to parse the given URL/split the given URL (Hint: Parse protocol or scheme, user info, host

address, port, path, ref, query string)

a."http://www.example.com:80/index.html"	

b." ftp://mp3:mp3@138.247.121.61:21000/c%3a/"

7) WAP to create URL objects for the given URLs and check if the given hostnames are the same or not?

(Hint: Use equals() method)

a. www.ibiblio.org and helios.ibiblio.org

b. http://www.ibiblio.org/and http://ibiblio.org/

8) List three predefined cookie Policy in java? WAP in java, A cookie policy that blocks all .gov cookies but allows other domains.

9) WAP that uses the HEAD request method and prints the last time a file on a server was modified (Given URL: http://scst.edu.np/uploads/content image/BCA Course Structure.png)

10) Write a client side program for daytime service using socket. (Specify host name: https://ntppool.org/zone/np.)

11) Write a program to find the TCP/UDP ports running in your local machine. (Hint: Use class name: LowPortScanner((1-1024)) Hint: Scan up to 65535, and use DatagramSocket for UDP and socket for TCP)

12) Write a program to display the socket information. (address, port, local address, local port) Write a

program to Implement your own daytime server.

13) Write a program for a daytime server using Thread pool.

14) Write a program for basic client server communication using TCP sockets. 15) Write a program for a Day Time protocol client using a UDP socket.

16) Write a socket program for UDP Echo Client and Echo Server

17) Write a program that can send "HELLO" messages to the Multicast group where the receiver should

be ready to receive the messages to the port number where MulticastSocket is bound.
